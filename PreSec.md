# 🧰 Pre-Security – Cyber Foundations by CyDieLia

This repo documents my journey through TryHackMe's **Pre-Security path** and early cybersecurity learning.

It’s a mix of **networking basics**, **terminal commands**, **OS concepts**, and tools I learned before jumping into offensive/defensive work.

---

## 🚀 Why Pre-Security Matters

Before exploitation, monitoring, or defending — you need to know:

- What the internet is
- What a port is
- What an OS is actually doing
- How to work in the terminal
- How IPs, DNS, and routing works
- And how to ask the right questions

## 🧠 What I Learned Here

| Area              | Topics                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Networking**     | IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, ping, traceroute, routing, firewalls               |
| **Linux Basics**   | Terminal usage, file system navigation, permissions, common commands  |
| **Windows Basics** | Powershell, processes, registry, file extensions                      |
| **Security Concepts** | Confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA), types of hackers    |
| **Tool Fluency**   | `ping`, `traceroute`, `ipconfig`, `whois`, `nslookup`, `nmap`         |

## 🧱 Building Blocks for Everything Ahead

I refer back to this repo when:
- I need to brush up on a core command
- I explain something to a friend new to cyber
- I want a quick list of "starter tools"

Even as I move deeper into pentesting and blue team work, **these skills remain the base layer**.
